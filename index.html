    <h1> about me</h1>
    <p> I really love learning new things through Wonder and and the fun of learning. Working with people and meeting New friend around the world hashelp me 
      to grow in who I am now. I believe one of the greatest gift we are given is ow we can connect to each other. Well enough of the lecture haha, I am a big 
      fan-boy of memes, you would probably notice it. Skate borading is one of the best thing I enjoy,  well dont forgot soccer that the greatest, Running yeah 
      do it a lot(*wispering* but not in a competition yet üòâ). I enjoy Challlege though, and especially solving real world problem, so I do take part of

      to solve real world problem, and so I am very intersted in cutural programs,like AFS and other online conference is base on learning other culture and the 
      great people in there or even connecting. I then sometimes find my self as working as a leader in teams, well I enjoy it as Ilove listenning to feedback I 
      the team and managing the team haha. Music nah,Dancing Maybe :).My free time, well I basically never have a free time as I am always busy doing and learning
       something new,but I can say I do give my self some free time  as i am on twitter,slack,chatting with people or looking at memes.I am sometimes not good to speak 
       to, as I am just work and Work some "people" are not like that, so I distance my self a lot I think. COding I has become my favorite thing to do, because it also 
       envolved thinking some times, especially in C++, Currenclty I am learning a lot, I can say basicallly everything, so I can reallly say What I am doing here,
