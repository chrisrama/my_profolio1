    <h1> about me</h1>
    <p> I enjoy working so hard in everything I do:smile: people describe me as a hard-working person who never stops in what I am going to do. one thing I believe is that if something has never been done that good, but that doesn’t mean I have to follow what others thought of that thing to never hard been done. I am fascinated about the world around us and how thee is everyday change, I want to be part of this change in teaching others to be the change they can be. I am currently a member at <a href="https://www.nyas.org/about/our-mission/">the new york academy of sciences</a> as a member of <a href="https://joinlaunchpad.com/#/profile/9670">the junior academy</a> I also enjoy working on <em>cultural programs </em>so to know how to work better with people. the new york academy of sciences is one of the great places to do so. I also like doing <em>researches</em> about we should one day be living. I am also a member of the space club </p>
